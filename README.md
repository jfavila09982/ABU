## Ensuring User Anonymity

ABU prioritizes user privacy and anonymity, especially when sending anonymous messages. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how user anonymity is maintained in the ABU app:

### Workflow for Achieving User Anonymity

1. **User A sends an anonymous message to User B**:
    - User A composes an anonymous message within the app and selects User B as the recipient.
    - The message is encrypted and sent to the server.

2. **Server receives and processes the message**:
    - The server receives the encrypted message from User A.
    - The server decrypts the message and removes any identifying information about User A.
    - The server stores the anonymous message in a secure database.

3. **User B receives the anonymous message**:
    - User B's device requests new messages from the server.
    - The server sends the anonymous message to User B's device.
    - User B's device decrypts the message and displays it in the app.
    - User B interacts with the message without knowing the identity of User A.

4. **Optional: Moderation and Filtering**:
    - The server may apply moderation and filtering algorithms to the message content to ensure compliance with community guidelines and prevent abuse or inappropriate content.

5. **Ensuring Anonymity**:
    - The app's architecture and encryption protocols ensure that user identities are kept confidential throughout the message exchange process.
    - User A's identity remains hidden from User B, preserving anonymity and encouraging open and honest communication.
